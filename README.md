# MedTech - Disease Prediction System ü©∫

MedTech is an intelligent, user-friendly disease prediction system designed to provide preliminary health insights based on user-reported symptoms. By leveraging a comprehensive database of diseases and their corresponding symptoms, this tool helps users identify potential health conditions, understand the associated risk levels, and find the appropriate medical specialist for consultation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application works by matching the user's selected symptoms against a predefined dictionary of diseases and their common symptoms.

1.  The user selects symptoms from a multi-select dropdown.
2.  The `detect_diseases` function calculates how many of the selected symptoms match the symptoms of each disease in the database.
3.  It identifies the disease(s) with the highest number of matches.
4.  For each likely disease, it retrieves and displays the predefined risk level and the recommended medical specialist(s).

## üíª Technologies Used

-   **Python**: The core programming language.
-   **Streamlit**: For building and deploying the interactive web application.
